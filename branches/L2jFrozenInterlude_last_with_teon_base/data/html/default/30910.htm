Grand Master Xairakin:
<br>
Heine, the city of water... those idiotic worshippers of Eva!
<br>
Those fools seem to have forgotten that Shilen came long before Eva...
<br>
How soon they forget Shilen's mastery of the dark water...
<br>
She must be laughing scornfully at their shallow joy from her place in the deepest abyss of the sea...
