Do you know the story of the seventeen heroes who challenged the Land
Dragon Antharas? It's fascinating! Such a heroic sacrifice! It could be
an epic poem! In fact, it's one of my all-time favorite stories! It's
what motivated me to become a bohemian poet! It's always been my dream
to write a great epic poem tying all the pieces of this story together.<br>
Well forget all that because we have made the quest simple !!<br>
I will make you Noblesse if you have a second Subclass at Level
70+ and if you have 2 gold bars in your inventory.<br>
