The protection blessing is a special protection given to character under level 39 who not made the second transfer.<br> 
While a character has this blessing, he or she cannot either inflict or receive damage when in combat with chaotic character 10 or more levels higher than they are. The protection does not apply to the battle field, however.<br> 
Would you like to receive the protection?<br>
