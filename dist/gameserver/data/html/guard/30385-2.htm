!Guard Weisz:

Recently a very interesting archeological site has been discovered whose origins are still unclear.

People who have seen it say that it is divided in two, a Temple of Fire and a Temple of Water.

By all accounts the place is swarming with monsters.

If you are interested, you should visit *Magister Nell* of the Mystics Guild.

They are trying to hire someone to investigate the site for them.
