According to the Ivory Tower's research, the Kamaloka came about because another dimension overlaps Aden. A Kamaloka possessed by a strong monster's soul is itself very powerful. That is we allow adventurers to enter only the Kamaloka that is appropriate for their level of skill and experience.<br>
The levels of each Kamaloka and the captains who guard admittance to them are as follows:<br>
<center>
Captain Bathis (Town of Gludio): Level 23, 26<br>
Captain Lucas (Town of Dion): Level 33, 36<br>
Captain Gosta (Heine): Level 43, 46<br>
Captain Mouen (Town of Oren): Level 53, 56<br>
Captain Vishotsky (Town of Schuttgart) Level 63, 66<br>
Captain Mathias (Rune Township): Level 73
