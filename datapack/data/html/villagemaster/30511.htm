I am Warehouse Chief Guesto of the Iron Gate. Our Iron Gate Guild's motto is to 'sell anything to any race if it is needed.' We are not hindered by the snowy fields, deserts, or volcanic regions. We are a magnificent guild that operates in all parts of the world, increasing the economic prosperity of the Dwarven race. Ha ha ha, aren't we magnificent?<br>
But you seems like a new face. Have we met before? Anyway, why have you come to me?<br>
but you're a new face, hmm? I don't think we've met before. What do you want?<br>
