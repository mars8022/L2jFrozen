<html><body>Fishing Guild Member O'Fulle:<br>
The name's O'Fulle! I'm a member of the local Fishermen's Guild. I'm the one you should see about any fishing needs you may have while in Giran!<br>
Giran has it all! Lots of <font color "LEVEL">money</font> and great fishing! Why don't you give it a try?<br>
Good luck! I hope you catch a whooper! Make sure not to catch any mermaids, though! They're nothing but trouble! Ha!<br>
